# Sam Soper Individual Project - ChoreTracker

### Problem Statement
For over 8 years, my wife and I have relied on various self-organization and
communication tactics to satisfactorily distribute domestic tasks in a mutually
beneficial way.  Sometimes we come close to figuring it out, but for the most 
part - we've failed.  Our current solution is a Kanban board that is tacked up
to a wall in our kitchen. It works, but only if we're not very busy and we 
remember to look at the board.

The major drawback of the board is that it is not mobile and thus it is 
unavailable to us when we're away.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It would great
to receive periodic notifications on our phones to remind us of chores we
need to do and errands we need to run.
