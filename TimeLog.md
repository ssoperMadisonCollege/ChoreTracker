| 9/30/17 | Completed design reviews for Jamie and Brooke, working on integrating all our exercises thus far into my individual project, starting with designing/normalizing the database. | 6 | Tough to commit to a database design right now.  Also, I lost my entire class design to a google drive/ draw.io syncing issue, had to start the class diagram from scratch. |
| 10/1/17 | Poked at the class diagram I lost yesterday.  | 0.5 | Frustrated. |
| 10/2/17 | Completed initial class diagram for individual project.  Writing database creation scripts.  | 4 | Playing catch-up from set-backs.  |
| 10/3/17 | Continued work on making database scripts.  Decided to focus on MVP for the individual project checkpoint: got hibernate working, User class, DAO, and DAOTest working.  Reorganized project structure.  | 4 | Feeling better, next step is to deploy to AWS.  | 
| 10/10/17 | Continued work on making database scripts.  Added feedback for professional development presentation from last week.  Set up a user_roles tables locally and modified my users table and DAO entities/tests to include a user_name.  | 2 |  |

Also going to work toward closing some open indie project github issues. |
| 10/17/17 | Working on checkpoint 3 requirements for the individual project. | 3 | I have been sick for the last several days and have been working long hours (no sick days, need money).  I committed about about 13 hours to a project for another class over the weekend.  Feeling very run down.  Found a useful stack overflow post for recording start dates and time intervals for my chores: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5183630/calendar-recurring-repeating-events-best-storage-method, and something on converting to unix timestamps from dates: https://www.epochconverter.com/programming/mysql |
| 10/18/17 | Finished checkpoint 3 requirements for the individual project.  Working on completing SOAP activities. | 6.5 | Working with classmates who have figured out some of the authentication/AWS gotchas is extremely helpful.  I cancelled my professional development presentation for next week - need to re-prioritize and gain some momentum on this project before focusing on that for the moment. #Agile #MVP  |
| 10/25/17 | Worked on REST activities, hashing out Git issues with team project. | 4 | Weekend was eaten up by AJAX class project and take home exam.  Thankfully Java EE was lighter this week. |

| 11/1/17 |  Plinking away at the multi-threading exercise, figuring out how to make my test database more robust | 2.5 | Got the multi-threading exercises working with a pointer from Jake "The Threadmaster/The Man" Stoffregen. Must run the program via a main method if you're closely following the Barber shop example. |
| 11/2/17 |  Moving JSPs into their own directory for organization.  Adding UserRole entity and Dao/tests. | .75 | Bus coding on the way to work. |
| 11/3/17 |  Tinkered with UserRole tests, stuff is slightly broken. | .5 |  |
| 11/5/17 |  Got tests running in a repeatable fashion with lots of hibernate tweaks.  Implemented testing for javabeans to increase code coverage. Could use some cleanup. | 6.5 | I learned a cool, concise way of testing javabeans today, link here: https://www.jdev.it/tips-unit-testing-javabeans/ |
